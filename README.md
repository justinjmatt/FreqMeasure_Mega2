**FreqMeasure_Mega2 Library**

FreqMeasure is a library by PaulStroffregen that measures the elapsed time during each cycle of an input frequency. This library is a duplicate of the existing FreqMeasure library with renamed variables and classes that allows you to measure two signals at a time on an Arduino Mega by using the two separate libraries. For a Mega, this library measures signals on pin 48 and the standard library measures signals on pin 49. To use this library, call member functions of the "FreqMeasure_p2" object instead of "FreqMeasure".
